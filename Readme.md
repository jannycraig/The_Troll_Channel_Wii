## The Troll Channel

The Troll Channel is a Homebrew App that allows you to view a meme database on your Wii.  

## Inital Installation

The Troll Channel is a Homebrew App that connects to a *meme database*.  
To install the Troll Channel, create a folder in the apps folder on your SD Card called `The Troll Channel`  
(If you do not have an apps folder, create one on the root of the SD Card.)  
Place the `icon.png`, `meta.mxl` and `boot.dol` files in the `The Troll Channel folder`.  
It should now be ready to go.  

## Installing the WAD

To install the channel on the Wii Menu, you will need a WAD manager.  
Place the WAD file into the WAD folder, which is on the root of the SD Card.  
(If you don't have a WAD folder, create one.)  
Launch the WAD manager, and install the channel.
